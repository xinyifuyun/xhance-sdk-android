# Xhance Android SDK Integration Documentation
---


## Including the SDK
Firstly, [Download](https://github.com/adrealm/xhance-sdk-android/releases) `XhanceSdk_xxx.aar` and `installreferrer_xxx.jar`, then include them into `libs` directory in your project.

*	If you use `AndroidStudio` to build project，please add the following compile statement to your app-level build.gradle (not project!).

```groovy
repositories {
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile(name: 'XhanceSdk_xxx', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'installreferrer_x.x.x', ext: 'jar')
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:15.0.1'
}
```

*	If using a development tool that doesn't support the `gradle`, but you can use the `aar` file, we've provided you with a play-services-base dependency library file, you can download the files and add them to your project.

*	If using a development tool that doesn't support to use the `aar` file, the `play-services-base` dependent library cannot be used in this case. Simply import the `installreferrer_xxx.jar` file, unzip the `XhanceSdk_xxx.aar` ,then rename the `classes.jar` and import it into the project. Finally copy the following codes into  `AndroidManifest.xml` file of your project.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.finsky.permission.BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE" />
	
<receiver android:name="com.xhance.sdk.install.receiver.XhanceInstallReferrerReceiver"
 	android:exported="true">
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER"/>
	</intent-filter>
</receiver>
```


## Initialize the SDK

Please register your application on portal. After registrating, refer to the initialization code generated by the website and initialize `XhanceSdk` in the`Application.onCreate()` .

**Sample code：**

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        XhanceSdk.initSdk(this, "e51f16e146c9434da8346745919f9b1f","MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBALiv/Sev4qeAe9xfiH6RuitV+uYrD3btNU8K2fWZWs+wEAcb8DuD0xdh9lUwKu17OReJV45a2T6DuQqE2uk038cCAwEAAQ==", "https://<your_track_host>/", "32400");
	}
}
```


## About DeepLink

If you want to know the `deeplink` information , you can call the following code to get the user's `deeplink` information after initialization.

```java
XhanceSdk.getDeepLink(getApplicationContext(), new XhanceDeepLinkCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onFetchDeepLink(XhanceDeepLink deepLink) {
        if (deepLink != null) {
            Log.i(TAG, "deeplink is " + deepLink.getTargetUri());
        } else {
            Log.i(TAG, "deeplink is null");
        }
    }
});
```


## About Google payment report
